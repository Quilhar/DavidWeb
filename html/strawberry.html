        <h2 class="head2">Where to Plant Strawberries</h2>
        <p>Basic considerations when locating a strawberry patch include</p>
    
        <ul>
            <li>Full sun</li>
            <li>Well drained, sandy loam with a soil pH from 5.8 to 6.2 is ideal</li>
            <li>Don't plant where tomatoes, potatoes, peppers or eggplant have grown recently</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Start with a rich, organic soil. apply a balanced fertilizer (10-10-10) at planting at the rate of one pound per 100 sq.ft.
            <br>Fertilize again after renovation of June bearers or second harvest of day neutrauls and everbearing types. Do not over
            <br>fertilizer or you wil have excessive leaf growth and poor flowering. Do not fertilizer strawberries late in the season in
            <br>colder climate to prevent new growth that will be damaged by frost.
